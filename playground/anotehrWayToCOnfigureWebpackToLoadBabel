title needs to be .babelrc
//if you want to you can use this file titled .babelrc in the root directory to let babel know what presets to use when it runs after webpack starts it up, just like we did on the build-babel command in pakcage.js. However, it just seems easier and more concise to me to set the presets values within webpack.config.js inside the module rules. either way works


{
  "presets" : [
    "env",
    "react"
  ]
}
